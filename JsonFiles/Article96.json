{"abstract":"Today's practitioners of dentistry can be overwhelmed by the need to analyze, understand, prioritize, and implement the extraordinary amounts of knowledge and technical skill required to practice ideal dentistry. Continuing education is not just necessary; an increasingly informed patient population demands it. Among many technological advancements, computers have permeated the mainstream of restorative dentistry. The conventional systems of radiography and impressioning are the latest to face a digital counterpart. This case presentation demonstrates how cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) and a dedicated digital impressioning system can be used alongside conventional techniques to obtain excellent esthetic and functional results.","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"authorId":"14358194","name":"B.
