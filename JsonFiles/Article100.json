{"abstract":"The way we collect, store, and share dental records of our patients is rapidly becoming digital. Many programs have been designed to run on a single computer or local network to handle various tasks, so selecting a system can be complex; it can require high acquisition costs, update fees, and installation difficulties. The purpose of this article is to explain the architecture, characteristics, and advantages related to Web-based Management Software. In particular, this article describes the first Web-based Electronic Medical Record (DocSapiens.com), which is able to view and edit DICOM files directly online.","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"authorId":"40300190","name":"P.
