{"abstract":"The authors studied current levels of computerization in dental clinics and the attitudes of dentists towards dental computerization in metropolises in China. A survey consisting of 22 questions was e-mailed or mailed to a random sample of 354 dentists. Of all respondents, 80.5% reported using a computer in their practice. The authors found that administrative tasks were the first to be computerized. A majority of respondents supported the statement that computerization is a benefit to patient care. The authors found that the computerization of dental clinics in Chinese metropolises is a few years behind that of western nations.","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"authorId":"2152179550","name":"Jian Hu","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/2152179550"},{"authorId":"2110750024","name":"Hao Yu","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/2110750024"},{"authorId":"144055620","name":"E.
