{"abstract":"Communicating personalized information to patients about the risks, benefits and other critical information about dental disease and treatment is often difficult for providers. In this research we developed a novel informed consent prototype that can accurately translate and communicate information to patients in a standardized and effective manner based on their diagnosis and prescribed treatment. In future work, we aim to integrate SmartConsent into the institutional electronic patient record (EPR) and determine its effectiveness in a randomized controlled study.","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"authorId":"5922767","name":"J.
