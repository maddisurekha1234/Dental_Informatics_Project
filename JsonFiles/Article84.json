{"abstract":"Chart recording and coding are the important processes in the healthcare informatics system, but there were only a few reports in the dentistry field. The objectives of this study are to study the qualities of dental chart recording and coding, as well as the achievement of lecture/workshop on this topic. The study was performed by auditing the patient's charts at the TU Dental Student Clinic from July 2011-August 2012. The chart recording mean scores ranged from 51.0-55.7%, whereas the errors in the coding process were presented in the coder part more than the doctor part. The lecture/workshop could improve the scores only in some topics.","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"authorId":"2485418","name":"Yosananda Chantravekin","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/2485418"},{"authorId":"2721439","name":"Munchulika Tasananutree","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/2721439"},{"authorId":"2343115","name":"Supitcha Santaphongse","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/2343115"},{"authorId":"2763400","name":"Anchisa Aittiwarapoj","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/2763400"}],"citationVelocity":0,"citations":[],"corpusId":37141582,"doi":"10.3233/978-1-61499-289-9-932","fieldsOfStudy":["Computer Science","Psychology","Medicine"],"influentialCitationCount":0,"isOpenAccess":false,"isPublisherLicensed":false,"is_open_access":false,"is_publisher_licensed":false,"numCitedBy":0,"numCiting":0,"paperId":"67c9a2e4153b2ce998ad63fa9cba59aedafc5d65","references":[],"s2FieldsOfStudy":[{"category":"Computer Science","source":"external"},{"category":"Psychology","source":"external"},{"category":"Medicine","source":"external"}],"title":"Qualities of Dental Chart Recording and Coding","topics":[{"topic":"Chart","topicId":"20535","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/topic/20535"},{"topic":"Coder Device Component","topicId":"100150","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/topic/100150"},{"topic":"Informatics (discipline)","topicId":"37667","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/topic/37667"},{"topic":"Patients","topicId":"153409","url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/topic/153409"}],"url":"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/67c9a2e4153b2ce998ad63fa9cba59aedafc5d65","venue":"MedInfo","year":2013}
