{"abstract":"Electronic healthcare documentation is the key element of electronic healthcare (eHealth). Electronic oral health record (EOHR) supporting oral medicine is discussed. To provide dentists with a methodology and instrument to create oral health documentation in more efficient way, support information exchange and integration in dental domain and to ease dental decision-making and forensic dentistry identification tasks.The proposed methodology is used to model lifelong EOHR based on a small specific ontology where the use of other classification systems and nomenclatures, e.g. SNODENT, is possible. EOHRwith Lifelong DentCross user interface was developed and it has been supporting dental care at the University Hospital in Prague-Motol. The user interface is working in four languages and controlled by voice or keyboard. Lifelong DentCross user interface is reflecting the way of the work in dentistry and the EOHR can provide both structured and free text information to oral medicine.","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"authorId":"32246566","name":"J.
