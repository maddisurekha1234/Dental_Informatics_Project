{"abstract":"In this study, we examined speech recognition functionality in four leading dental practice management systems. Twenty dental students used voice to chart a simulated patient with 18 findings in each system. Results show it can take over a minute to chart one finding and that users frequently have to repeat commands. Limited functionality, poor usability and a high error rate appear to retard adoption of speech recognition in dentistry.","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"authorId":"2267736","name":"J.
