{"abstract":"We present the results of a field study of some of the work practices and software used by dentists. We also present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a user interface that streamlines some of these practices, as well as providing a novel 3D visualization of a patient's mouth that also displays relevant radiographs depending on what teeth are visible in the visualization. Dentists found the 3D synchronized navigation intuitive, even with little to no 3D navigation experience, but further research is needed to see the effect on real clinical outcomes.","arxivId":null,"authors":[{"authorId":"46635890","name":"Michael F.
